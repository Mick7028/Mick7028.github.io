## Project description

This program sorts (highest to lowest) a text file containing lines of names with their score, calculates the average score of the participants, and then determines the highest score. The program reads the original text file of scores, and then creates three new text files for a sorted list of scores, the average of the scores, and the highest score. 

## How to compile / run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./lab04
perl lab4.pl
```

## UI Design

The user interface of this program is command line, but since it does create text files the results will be shown below.
